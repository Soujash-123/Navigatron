1. Imports:
   - `sys`: System-specific parameters and functions.
   - `QCoreApplication`, `QUrl`, `QAction`, `QToolBar`, `QLineEdit`: Classes from PyQt5 for GUI application development.
   - `QMainWindow`: Main application window.
   - `QWebEngineView`: Widget for rendering web content in PyQt5.
   - `QApplication`: Represents the application.

2. WebBrowser Class:
   - Subclass of `QMainWindow` representing the main window of the web browser.
   - Initializes the browser with a default homepage (Google) and sets up the UI components.
   - Navigation bar with back, forward, refresh, home, and stop buttons.
   - URL bar for manual input of web addresses.
   - Methods like `navigate_home`, `navigate_to_url`, and `update_urlbar` for handling navigation actions and updating UI.

3. Methods:
   - `navigate_home`: Sets the browser's URL to the default homepage (Google).
   - `navigate_to_url`: Reads the URL from the URL bar, adds "http://" if missing, and sets it as the browser's URL.
   - `update_urlbar`: Updates the URL bar with the current page's URL.

4. Main Function (`main`):
   - Initializes the `QApplication` and creates an instance of the `WebBrowser` class.
   - Sets the application name to "Web Browser."
   - Shows the main window and starts the application event loop with `app.exec_()`.

5. Usage:
   - Run the script, and a window titled "Web Browser" will appear.
   - The browser loads the default homepage (Google).
   - Use the navigation buttons (Back, Forward, Refresh, Home, Stop) or type a URL in the URL bar.
   - Press Enter or click the Go button to navigate to the entered URL.
   - The URL bar updates dynamically as you navigate.
   - Close the application window when done.

Note: Ensure that you have PyQt5 installed (`pip install PyQt5 PyQtWebEngine`) before running the code. The web browser is a basic example and lacks advanced features commonly found in modern browsers.
